RAD (Reader Adaptive Documentation) text contains markup that indicate which blocks of text should be printed and which should be suppressed.  RAD blocks are marked with
.Ar rad-begin
and
.Ar rad-end
placed by themselves on a single line, accompanied by one or more RAD selectors.
.Pp
Selectors must be of the form "/vsn/interface," e.g., "/2.8/UI."  This is the first part of the document URL at https://maas.io/docs, so that website can be used as a source of correct selectors.  
.Pp
Any block of text which is enclosed between RAD selectors that match the input selector is also transferred to stdout.  Any blocks enclosed between selectors that do not match are not transferred.  The RAD block markers are never transferred.
.Pp
Any block of text that is not enclosed between RAD selectors is automatically transferred to stdout.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns EINVAL if the argument list is not the correct length, or if any of the values are corrupted in any way.
