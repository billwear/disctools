.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
scans the designated discourse topic identified by
.Ar index_topic_number
in the discourse docs instantiation described by
.Ar auth_file_name
and updates a table of URLs versus topic numbers in
.Ar db_file_name.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
.Nm
creates the database file and table if necessary.
.Pp
.Nm
expects a URL table of the form
"|https://<discourse API endpoint>/t/-/<topic-number>|<assigned-url>|"
to be found in the index topic, set off by a detail section preceded by the heading
"## URLs",
followed by a table heading, which is ignored.
.Nm
then converts it to a sqlite table with the
.Ar <topic-number>
in the first column and the
.Ar <assigned-url>
in the second column.
.Pp
This database is subsequently used by both
.Ar rlink(7)
and
.Ar rmenu(7)
to produce adjusted RAD links and RAD menus, respectively.
.Sh FILES          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Ar /etc/rad/rad.db
is the RAD database.  This database contains one table, named
.Ar links,
that contains three fields:
.Ar id
(the unique primary key, an assigned integer),
.Ar url
(a text string containing the entire URL from the URL table in the index document), and
.Ar topic_number
(an integer representing the discourse topic number associated with the
.Ar url
field.
.Pp
Note that 
.Nm
does not invoke superuser privileges when running, so the default database file kept at
.Ar /etc/rad/rad.db
cannot be written by
.Nm
under normal conditions.  The general expectation is that the user will indicate a local database
filename, and then use
.Ar sudo
as necessary to replace the system database, if desired.
.Sh ERRORS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs
.Nm
generates
.Ar EINVAL
if the command line arguments are unintelligible or corrupt.
